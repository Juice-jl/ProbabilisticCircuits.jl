# [Learning](@id man-learning)

In this section we provide few learning scenarios for circuits. In general, learning tasks for PCs can be separted into two categories: parameter learning and structure learning.

## Structures

Currently we are supporting the following structures:

- HiddenChowLiuTrees: See [`hclt`](@ref).
- RAT-SPNs: See [`random_region_graph`](@ref), and [`region_graph_2_pc`](@ref).

## Parameter Learning

Currently we are supporting the following parameters learning APIs:

- [`mini_batch_em`](@ref)
- [`full_batch_em`](@ref)

## Future Docs

- Learning a circuit from missing data
- Learn a mixture of circuits
- Learn a circuit from logical constraints and data
